# Pymaceuticals

This project utilizes Python to analyze mock pre-clinical (mouse trial) data for several fictional cancer drugs.

The analyses and visualizations include:

- Tumor proliferation over time
- Average tumor size over time
- Mouse mortality throughout the trial
- Variability between cohorts in the trial

Visualizations are produced with matplotlib and data cleaning/analysis is accomplished with Pandas and numpy.  An additional repo was created to provide a more interactive web-based experience using the visuals and discussion from this project.  See githubpages collection [here](https://bman511.github.io/DataStory/) and the repo [here](https://github.com/bman511/DataStory).
